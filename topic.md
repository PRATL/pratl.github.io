### What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual Reality is the new gaming method that has been taking the world by storm. The premise is that the user wears a headset that has a
screen built into it and modules that let the player see, hear, and move objects and interact with the enviornment through a built-in
screen, headphone inputs that you can plug headphones into, and wired/or wireless controls that imitate *hands*.

### Is Virtual Reality truly immersive?

The answer is absolutely. There are alot of new games that have been created for virtual reality that can put you into the drivers seat of
a car, or inside of a tank, or embody pilot that flies a starship. Each game has a truly immersive feel to it that makes you feel like you
are doing the real thing. With technology always advancing, better graphics and advanded gadgets are being brought in to make it even more
of a realist feel when you put the headset on. 

### How does Virtual reality work?

VR works by using a *Steroscopic* display. The display uses angles that allow the user to feel depth between each eye like seeing and
literally lowing yourself in front of the camera to grab an object with the controller in your real hands. Virtual Reality also uses
specific refresh rates that are (typically) matching the frames per second you get while playing a game. For example, the Playstation
Virtual Reality Headset (PSVR) has a refresh rate of 60hz and puts out 60fps while other (more expensive) headsets put out 90hz and plays
games at 90 fps.
  
Another big thing is latency. If the latency is to high the VR headset cannot do its job, that is to *trick* your mind into believing
it is in another world. Our eyes are very good at detecting anything abnormal to regular vision our brains are used and field of view
is another big deal. Humans have a FOV of 180 and the best VR headset has a FOV of 120. If the user is prone to any illness involving with
near or farsightedness, or feeling carsick or seasick kind of illness, it could be a problem for the user if VR is at an extended use.
