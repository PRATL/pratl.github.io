### My Hobbies

---

For my hobbies I really enjoy playing my drums and playing video games with friends. I have been playing the drums for about 10 years now
and I still have alot of work to do before I can even compare to the greats like Travis Barker or Neil Pert. I also have been playing video
games since I was about 9 years old and I havent stopped since. I have been in 4 differnet bands back in High School from 2010 til 2015.
All have been heavy metal bands and I will always miss my first little concert at battle of the bands in my Freshman year of highschool
playing with 2 seniors and one guy who already graduated. Our band was called **Thoughts Before Suicide**. The name wasn't my choice I
promise! Here's 2 video links to the concert we put on, although we had a very poor vocalist and also the sound quality sounds minimal.
**Caution! It's heavy metal so be prepared!**
